In this project, three different types of recommendation system algorithms were developed and applied on the MovieLens 100K dataset, including hybrid recommendation system using content-based filtering (${\bf CBF}$) & collaborative filtering (${\bf CF}$) recommenders, ${\bf XGBoost}$ and graph neural network (${\bf GNN}$).
